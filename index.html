				<p>In the beginning of the whole pandemic thing I had purchased my first synthesizer (a Korg Minilogue) and this was one of the first tracks i used it on. It has a much more four on the floor feel than what I typically make but i had a lot of fun making it. It was one of those that just came together.</p>
				<p>You can listen to this one on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/halfdeepmusic/white-christmas">my soundcloud</a>.</p>

				I made this one way back in 2017, It was the first song I remember being proud of.
				Looking back theres still things I would like to fix but I dont have the original project files any more.
				So as an excersise in fighting perfectionism I uploaded this one as my first release to distrokid (an excellent music distribution platform that helps to get your music on all the streaming sites and stores).	
				If you wnat to give it a listen its available on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1nAYJCIpTE5bru3FN1e3T2">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/za/album/bloom-single/1533173577">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=YBJIUvD6YCE&feature=share">Youtube Music</a>, and all the others too.

				<p>
					If you didnt already gather, my name is Half Deep.
					I am a musician and producer that currently makes instrumental music.
					I am a sucker for a good ambient piece and love music that that conveys emotions.
					One of my favorite music quotes is by the great Brian Eno
				</p>
				<br>
				<q>
					[Ambient] Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting. ~ Brian Eno
