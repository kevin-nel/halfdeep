					<h2>Working On An Ambient EP</h2>
					<p>I am starting to complete some songs for an ambient EP. It's kind of Boards of Canada esque but with less percussion. Lot's of analog synth and maybe some guitar. I can't wait to share it with you all!

					<h2>My Music Will No Be Longer Available On Apple Music And Spotify</h2>
					<p>Unfortunately I had to take my down from the popular streaming services as it was just not worth it for me to pay to keep it up. You can still get downloads of my music on <a href="https://halfdeep.bandcamp.com/album/lunar">bandcamp</a> or listen to it on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/halfdeepmusic/white-christmas">soundcloud</a>. Feel free to contact me about it and I will gladly give you a discount code for a download on bandcamp! I will make the music available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyGNowVYMarUYd8cGM7zQPQ?view_as=subscriber">my youtube</a> in the coming weeks.</p>

				<img class="center" src="music/white-christmas.png" alt="album artwork for the track, white christmas, by Half Deep">
				<p>In the beginning of the whole pandemic thing I had purchased my first synthesizer (a Korg Minilogue) and this was one of the first tracks i used it on. It has a much more four on the floor feel than what I typically make but i had a lot of fun making it. It was one of those that just came together.</p>
				<p>You can listen to this one on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/halfdeepmusic/white-christmas">my soundcloud</a>.</p>

				I made this one way back in 2017, It was the first song I remember being proud of.
				Looking back theres still things I would like to fix but I dont have the original project files any more.
				So as an excersise in fighting perfectionism I uploaded this one as my first release to distrokid (an excellent music distribution platform that helps to get your music on all the streaming sites and stores).	
				If you wnat to give it a listen its available on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1nAYJCIpTE5bru3FN1e3T2">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/za/album/bloom-single/1533173577">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=YBJIUvD6YCE&feature=share">Youtube Music</a>, and all the others too.
